# Terrain Generation
1. I have coded a 3D Terrain Generation program in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisities
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works
 It will start generating the terrain as soon as you open the program. You can set bumpiness factor of the terrain (increase to add more hills and decrease for flatter terrain) by changing the bump_factor variable in the program.
